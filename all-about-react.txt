Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
